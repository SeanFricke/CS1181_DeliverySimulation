# Delivery Simulation
## Synopsis 
Simulation to find optimal number of trucks vs drones.
There will be a train running between start and end.
Shortest delivery time is optimization value.
Trucks and drones do not need to be considered for their return to start. Every 'delivery object' will make a single trip.

## Metrics
### Environment
1,500 packages daily
30,000 'unit' travel path
3,000 'units' from start to train tracks
27,000 'units' from tracks to end

### Trucks 
10 package capacity
30 units/min speed
15 min departure interval

### Drones
1 package capacity
300 units/min speed
3 min departure interval

## Train Schedule
text file of space seperated values
List of every train stop to the tracks
First number is timestamp (in min) of stops
Second number is duration (in min) of stops
Timestamp of stop end is [value 1 + value 2]

## Simulation variables
### Percent of drones
A variable called PERCENT_BY_DRONE that indicated percentage of drones in play (out of all packages delivered)
Number of packages times percent (or the remaining percent for trucks) is the number of drones (or trucks) that will need to be in the sim
Round up if uneven.

## Truck Calculations
Discrete event simulation must be used
Events include:
### TRUCK_START
Event happens at departure
First truck starts at 0.0, and then intervals from then.
Next event calculated with distance from start to tracks.
### TRUCK_AT_CROSSING
Event happens when reaching tracks
If no train blocking the cross, continue immediately
If train is stopped, or there is currently a line of trucks still yet to cross, wait.
Add waiting trucks to FIFO structure.
Trucks go in intervals of 1 min as they leave the line and cross.
First truck leaves line 1 min after train leaves.
### TRUCK_CROSS
Event happens when tracks are crossed (immediately after TRUCK_AT_CROSSING or after it leaves the line) 
Same as TRUCK_START in the calculation till next event.
### TRUCK_END
Event Happens when truck reaches the end.
### Other info
Trucks must be stored in a priority queue that is sorted by next event time.
Once event is reached, do code and put back in the queue with updated info for the next event.
Train events take priority over truck events
TRUCK_AT_CROSSING logic takes priority over TRUCK_CROSS logic if at same time.

## Drone Calculations
Total time for one drone to complete trip
Total time for all drones to complete trip. Drones can be ran in parallel.
First drone takes off at 0.0, and intervals after.
Simple calculation to end since no train logic is needed
